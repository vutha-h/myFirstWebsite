        <p>
            So actually i want to let you know that graphic design and other are almost taking over by the freaking AI generated ... and i found out that
            by doing the freaking coding, it could be the best result ... i mean it help alot in the future i guess ... everything mostly move from physical 
            into digital and i really think that i would be the best thing that could ever happen to us. Meta verse, web 3 and all ... and so yeah .. you 
            know who can stop it? it's only developing further and further now .... let's see.
